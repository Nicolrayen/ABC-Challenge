# Begin this activity by...
> Having a scrum meeting!
>
> Your team should create a project board and then create cards and issues for each task. This is repetitive and is meant to be used as practice. Start your first sprint by prioritizing the first easy tasks(letters as an example) people can access; once everyone is done with their tasks, close the card & issues and then move to the next issue.
>
> Practice branching in your repository by creating a new branch for every task you work on. For example, if you personally get tasked with the letter C - F, then create a branch called "letterC-F". Once you finish those letters and are done with the branch, make sure to create a new branch for your next letters. For example, if you are next tasked with letterG-I, your branch would be "letterG-I".

## Useful commands for creating and moving to branches...
    - `git branch` (shows current local branches)
    - `git branch branchName` (creates a new branch)
    - `git checkout branchName` (moves you to the branch listed)
    - `git checkout -b branchName` (creates a new branch and moves you to it)

## How to push a branch... 
    - `git status`
    - `git add .`
    - `git commit -m 'messages'`
    - `git status`
    - `git pull origin main`
    - `git push origin branchName`
